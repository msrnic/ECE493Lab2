## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: all checklist items pass.
- The specification explicitly resolves CHK003, CHK004, CHK005, CHK006, CHK007, CHK008, CHK009, CHK010, CHK011, CHK013, CHK014, CHK015, CHK016, CHK017, CHK020, CHK023, CHK024, CHK025, CHK026, CHK027, CHK028, and CHK029.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
