## Implementation Baseline

- Functional requirements come from `Use Cases/UC-XX.md`.
- Acceptance criteria come from `Acceptance Tests/UC-XX-AS.md`.
- Acceptance validation must include coverage evidence targeting 100% line coverage for
  project-owned JavaScript (or documented exception as close to 100% as possible).
- Implementation stack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Architecture is Model-View-Controller (MVC).
- All scoped use cases and acceptance suites must be implemented exactly as specified.

See `lab2/.specify/memory/constitution.md` for full governance and delivery rules.
