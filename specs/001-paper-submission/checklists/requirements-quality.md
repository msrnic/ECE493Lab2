# Requirements Quality Checklist: Author Paper Submission

**Purpose**: Validate requirement quality for UC-04 submission scope (completeness, clarity,
consistency, measurability, and scenario coverage).
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: `/home/m_srnic/ece493/lab2/ECE493Lab2/specs/001-paper-submission/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context
and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are submission-entry requirements defined for session-expired authors in addition to
  logged-in preconditions? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §Preconditions, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK002 Are required metadata fields explicitly enumerated rather than deferred to external
  policy text? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK003 Are minimum required file categories for a valid submission package explicitly
  specified? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “clear confirmation outcome” defined with mandatory content and identifiers?
  [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “active session” defined with precise start/end conditions for retry eligibility?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK006 Are file-policy requirements traceable to a concrete rule source/version to avoid
  interpretation drift? [Clarity, Dependency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Dependencies]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do duplicate-submission boundaries align between FR wording and edge-case statements?
  [Consistency, Spec §FR-009, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK008 Are save-failure expectations consistent between clarifications and measurable
  outcomes? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §SC-007]
- [ ] CHK009 Are retry-preservation requirements consistent across FR-011/FR-012/FR-014 and
  SC-008/SC-010? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-014, Spec §SC-008, Spec §SC-010]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance statements specific enough to distinguish validation failure, upload
  failure, and save failure outcomes? [Measurability, Gap, Acceptance §UC-04-AS, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK011 Is each functional requirement mapped to objective acceptance evidence beyond binary
  pass/fail phrasing? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Traceability Matrix, Spec §FR-001..FR-014]
- [ ] CHK012 Are measurement methods for SC-002 and SC-005 defined with sample size, environment,
  and calculation rules? [Measurability, Gap, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are alternate-flow requirements defined for repeated upload failures beyond a single
  retry prompt? [Coverage, Spec §FR-012, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 Are exception-flow requirements defined for persistence-layer unavailability separate
  from upload failure? [Coverage, Exception Flow, Gap, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK015 Are recovery-flow requirements defined for re-authentication and continuation after
  session expiration? [Coverage, Recovery, Gap, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-014]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for mixed outcomes where one file upload succeeds and another
  fails within the same action sequence? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK017 Are requirements defined for concurrent submit attempts from multiple tabs in one
  action sequence? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK018 Are timeout or unavailable-scan responses specified distinctly from explicit
  scan-failure responses? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-013, Spec §Dependencies]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK019 Are step-level latency requirements defined for upload, validation, submit, and retry
  feedback instead of only journey-level timing? [NFR, Gap, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK020 Are accessibility requirements specified for validation feedback and retry guidance
  presentation? [NFR, Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK021 Are security/privacy retention and disposal requirements specified for session-preserved
  metadata and files? [NFR, Gap, Spec §FR-014, Spec §Dependencies]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK022 Is each dependency paired with explicit failure-handling requirements and ownership
  boundaries? [Dependency, Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK023 Are assumptions about session availability supported by explicit fallback requirements?
  [Assumption, Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Are malware-scanning dependency contracts defined with requirement-level input/output
  expectations and retry semantics? [Dependency, Clarity, Gap, Spec §FR-013]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK025 Is “submission action sequence” formally defined to prevent team-level interpretation
  variance? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK026 Are criteria for “valid uploaded files” preservation fully defined for mixed validation
  results? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK027 Does coverage language reconcile 100% target vs remediation path below 100% with
  explicit exception authority and timing? [Conflict, Spec §FR-010, Constitution §II]
