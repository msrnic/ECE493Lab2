# Requirements Quality Checklist: Reviewer Invitation Delivery

**Purpose**: Validate that UC-07 invitation-delivery requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable before implementation/review.
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: /home/m_srnic/ece493/lab2/ECE493Lab2/specs/001-receive-review-invitation/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are invitation-trigger requirements defined for every assignment source type (manual, bulk, import) or intentionally scoped to one source? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-001, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK002 Are required dispatch inputs (assignment ID, reviewer identity, paper identity, contact validity) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-001, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK003 Are required data fields for each invitation status transition fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK004 Are post-failure follow-up requirements specified beyond flag creation (owner, SLA, escalation path)? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is "immediately after assignment" quantified with a measurable time threshold that reviewers can apply consistently? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK006 Is "stop retries immediately" clarified for race conditions such as in-flight attempts and delayed acknowledgments? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "active invitation record" defined with explicit criteria that distinguish active vs historical records? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK008 Are required failure-log details defined precisely enough to avoid interpretation drift across teams? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006, Spec §User Story 3]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Do retry-limit statements stay consistent across clarifications, FR-004, and SC-008 (cadence and cap)? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-008]
- [ ] CHK010 Do failure-log access requirements align between clarification notes and FR-009 role wording? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK011 Do delivery-timing criteria align with retry-cadence rules without contradictory expectations? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK012 Are traceability mappings consistent between requirements table entries and user-story acceptance scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §Traceability Matrix, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are all success criteria objectively measurable with clear population and timeframe definitions? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK014 Is SC-005 measurement methodology specified (survey method, sample size, acceptance threshold calculation)? [Acceptance Criteria, Gap, Spec §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK015 Are acceptance thresholds stated as unambiguous pass/fail boundaries rather than qualitative interpretations? [Acceptance Criteria, Clarity, Spec §SC-001 to §SC-011]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the coverage-exception path tied to explicit approval authority and evidence artifacts? [Traceability, Spec §FR-008, Spec §SC-007]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are primary, alternate, exception, and recovery scenario classes all represented in explicit requirement statements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements defined for delayed success acknowledgments after retry execution has started? [Coverage, Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK019 Are authorization-denial requirements specified for both behavior and audit evidence when unauthorized users request logs? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §FR-009, Spec §SC-009]
- [ ] CHK020 Are reassignment scenarios specified for transitions after invitation cancellation or terminal failure? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are missing or invalid reviewer contact-detail scenarios addressed with explicit status-outcome requirements? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are prolonged notification outage scenarios bounded by explicit escalation or remediation requirements? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are concurrency edge cases specified for duplicate callbacks, parallel retry workers, and duplicate assignment events? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 Are non-functional requirements defined for failure-log retrieval performance in addition to delivery latency? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §SC-002, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK025 Are security requirements explicit for determining editor-of-paper authorization at decision time? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK026 Are observability requirements defined for retry drift, dropped retries, and alerting thresholds? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §FR-006, Spec §SC-008]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 Are notification-provider dependency requirements documented with expected success/failure payload schema? [Dependency, Gap, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK028 Is the assumption about upstream assignment-event integrity validated by fallback requirements for malformed events? [Assumption, Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK029 Are dependency-failure requirements defined for unavailable role/permission data during failure-log authorization? [Dependency, Gap, Spec §FR-009, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK030 Is "manual follow-up" defined with a concrete responsible role and action deadline? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK031 Are potential conflicts resolved between "one active invitation" constraints and historical audit-retention expectations? [Conflict, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK032 Is a stable requirement-ID-to-acceptance-assertion mapping scheme documented for reviewer traceability? [Traceability, Gap, Spec §Traceability Matrix]

## Notes

- Mark items complete with `[x]` when requirement text quality is sufficient.
- Capture findings inline beside each checklist item.
- Add references to spec/plan updates created to resolve identified gaps.
