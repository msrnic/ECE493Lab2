**Purpose**: Evaluate requirement quality for UC-01 registration scope before implementation/testing expansion.
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements specified for all registration entry paths, including explicit navigation and direct access expectations? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Are required registration fields fully enumerated as authoritative requirements rather than partial assumptions? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are confirmation-email content requirements defined (required fields, confirmation token/link expectations, and user guidance)? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Are retry submission requirements documented for network interruption and safe re-submission outcomes? [Gap, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is timing language such as "expected shortly" quantified with explicit thresholds? [Ambiguity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK006 Is "clear user feedback" for throttling defined with required message content and retry guidance detail? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK007 Are validation requirements explicit about field-level error structure for missing versus invalid inputs? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do account-status requirements remain consistent between pending-on-create and activation-on-confirmation statements across all sections? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK009 Do source use case end conditions align with specification rules for pending account activation timing? [Conflict, Use Cases/UC-01, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK010 Are coverage requirements consistent between Constitution Alignment and FR-007 wording? [Consistency, Spec §Constitution Alignment, Spec §FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Are FR-008/FR-009/FR-010/FR-012 each mapped to explicit measurable success criteria rather than inferred outcomes? [Gap, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-012, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK012 Can SC-004 usability requirements be objectively measured with a defined participant profile and sample-size rule? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK013 Are SC-005 timing requirements unambiguous about when timing starts and ends? [Clarity, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are alternate-flow requirements defined for users who are already authenticated but attempt registration? [Gap, Spec §Preconditions]
- [ ] CHK015 Are exception-flow requirements defined for invalid, expired, or reused confirmation tokens? [Gap, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK016 Are recovery requirements defined when confirmation email retries are exhausted without delivery? [Gap, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK017 Are multi-step correction scenarios covered when users fix one invalid field while others remain invalid? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-006]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are duplicate-email rules explicit about canonicalization behavior (case, whitespace, and equivalent forms)? [Gap, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK019 Are boundary limits fully specified for all input lengths and allowed character classes? [Gap, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK020 Are concurrent same-email submission scenarios addressed with deterministic requirement outcomes? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are security requirements for credential handling explicitly documented beyond strength policy (transit and storage expectations)? [Gap, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK022 Are accessibility requirements defined for form controls, focus order, and error announcement behavior? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 Are reliability requirements for email retry policy quantified (retry cadence, max attempts, terminal state)? [Gap, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK024 Are performance thresholds for registration responsiveness stated as measurable acceptance requirements? [Gap, Spec §SC-005]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK025 Are email-service dependency expectations documented with explicit failure assumptions and required fallback behavior? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK026 Is the duplicate-email dependency tied to an explicit source of truth for uniqueness decisions? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK027 Is the assumption wording "at least name, unique email, and password" resolved into a final required field set? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK028 Is "temporarily block" defined with precise unblock semantics and user-visible timing rules? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK029 Are "pending" and "successful confirmation" defined as explicit state transitions with unambiguous preconditions? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK030 Is there a requirement ID scheme for clarifications/edge-case statements so they remain traceable to acceptance expectations? [Traceability, Spec §Traceability Matrix, Spec §Clarifications]
