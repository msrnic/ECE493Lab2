**Purpose**: Validate the quality of written requirements for schedule publication visibility, personalization, and notice behavior.
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are access-policy requirements defined for every viewer context (unauthenticated, authenticated non-author, authenticated author) across both publication states? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements explicit about which data elements constitute the "full final conference schedule" (content scope, ordering, and grouping)? [Completeness, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for authenticated authors with no assigned sessions beyond the statement that no session is highlighted? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK004 Are direct-link access requirements specified for both published and unpublished states across all viewer contexts? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is "clear notice" quantified with objective content expectations so interpretation does not vary by reviewer? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK006 Is "visibly highlight" defined with measurable criteria that distinguish compliant vs non-compliant emphasis? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "single navigation to the schedule view" defined with precise start and end boundaries? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "within 2 actions after login" defined with explicit action-counting rules? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK009 Is fallback behavior specified when the device/browser local time zone cannot be determined? [Gap, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do FR-001, FR-006, and FR-009 use consistent access-policy wording for unauthenticated viewers in each publication state? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK011 Do user-story acceptance scenarios align with functional requirements on when login is or is not required? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK012 Does FR-007 add uniquely testable requirement value rather than duplicating other FRs in a way that can create interpretation conflicts? [Consistency, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 Is traceability consistent between the traceability matrix and requirement statements with no missing or mismatched IDs? [Consistency, Traceability, Spec §Traceability Matrix, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 Are success criteria objectively measurable without relying on subjective interpretation? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-006]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the SC-006 sampling method specified (sample size, participant mix, measurement method) so the 95% threshold is reproducible? [Acceptance Criteria, Gap, Spec §SC-006]
- [ ] CHK016 Are unpublished-state acceptance outcomes for "0 schedule entries" directly tied to explicit visibility requirements? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK017 Are functional requirements and success criteria mapped so each FR has at least one measurable validation target? [Traceability, Gap, Spec §Traceability Matrix, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary published-state requirements complete for both unauthenticated viewers and authenticated authors? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK019 Are alternate-path requirements specified for authenticated non-author viewers in published state (full visibility without personalization)? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §Viewer Context, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK020 Are exception-path requirements documented for schedule retrieval failure, stale publication status, or partial schedule data availability? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 Are recovery-path requirements defined for publication-status changes while a viewer is actively on the page? [Recovery, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are intentionally out-of-scope scenarios explicitly documented to prevent assumption-driven scope expansion? [Scope, Gap, Spec §Assumptions]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements defined for published schedules that contain zero entries globally, not only zero entries for a specific author? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Are requirements defined for overlapping or duplicate author session assignments and expected highlight behavior? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements defined for conference/local time values that cross date boundaries (day rollover)? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK026 Are requirements defined for malformed or expired direct links targeting the schedule view? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK027 Are performance requirements explicitly specified in the feature requirements (not only in planning artifacts)? [Non-Functional, Gap, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK028 Are accessibility requirements specified for notice comprehension and highlight distinguishability, including non-color cues? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [ ] CHK029 Are localization requirements defined for notice text language and time-format conventions? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK030 Are privacy requirements defined to prevent exposing author-identity signals to unauthenticated viewers? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §FR-006]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about publication-status reliability paired with requirements for unavailable or contradictory status data? [Assumption, Gap, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Are dependency contracts for authentication context and publication status documented with freshness and failure expectations? [Dependency, Gap, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK033 Is the single global publication-status assumption validated against phased or partial publication possibilities? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK034 Is "full final conference schedule" unambiguous about withdrawn sessions, hidden items, or metadata exclusions? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK035 Do any sections conflict on whether personalized author details are available only in authenticated contexts? [Conflict, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK036 Is a conflict-resolution rule documented for future requirement updates while preserving UC-15 traceability commitments? [Ambiguity, Gap, Spec §Constitution Alignment]
