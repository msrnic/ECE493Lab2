**Purpose**: Validate the quality of access-control, outage-handling, and audit-traceability requirements for UC-08.
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [/home/m_srnic/ece493/lab2/ECE493Lab2/specs/001-reviewer-paper-access/spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are requirements defined for authentication, assignment validation, and revocation as distinct access gates rather than a single combined rule? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are requirements documented for both successful access outcomes and denied/unavailable/throttled outcomes in the same reviewer-paper flow? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements specified for who may view access-attempt records and who may not, including non-editor authenticated users? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008, Spec §SC-009]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are required attributes for access-attempt records sufficiently defined to support troubleshooting and audit review? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 - Is the phrase "clear denial outcome" quantified with required message content, tone, or minimum informational elements? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is "temporary unavailability outcome" defined with explicit distinction from access revocation language? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, Spec §SC-010]
- [ ] CHK007 - Is "already displayed content remains visible" defined with explicit boundary conditions for what counts as already displayed content? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010, Spec §SC-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 - Do revocation requirements remain internally consistent between immediate denial on new requests and preservation of previously displayed content? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK009 - Do temporary-outage requirements consistently separate service unavailability from authorization denial across requirements and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-009, Spec §SC-010]
- [ ] CHK010 - Do access-record visibility requirements align between functional requirements, edge cases, and measurable outcomes? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §SC-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 - Are all measurable outcomes objectively testable without relying on interpretation-heavy terms? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-003, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are thresholds and denominators explicit for timing and throttling outcomes (for example population, time window, and retry sequence)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-012]
- [ ] CHK013 - Is the quality bar for coverage evidence unambiguous about justification and approval conditions below 100%? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §SC-007]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 - Are primary success-flow requirements complete from reviewer authentication through paper-file availability and display outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are alternate and exception-flow requirements complete for revoked access and temporary file outages? [Coverage, Exception Flow, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are recovery-flow requirements defined after temporary outages, including retry progression from immediate retry to throttled retries? [Coverage, Recovery Flow, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 - Are requirements defined for session-expiry timing boundaries between paper selection and subsequent file requests? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Gap]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are requirements explicit for partial assignment changes while viewing available papers, including required reconciliation behavior? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Gap]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are requirements complete for requests to unassigned papers so outcomes and messages remain distinct from revocation and temporary outage outcomes? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-005]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 - Are performance requirements complete for all high-priority outcomes, not only successful authorized file access? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK021 - Are security/privacy requirements defined for access-attempt record retention, exposure limits, and sensitive field handling? [Non-Functional, Security, Gap, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are operability requirements defined for monitoring and alerting on denied-revoked, temporary-unavailable, and throttled outcome rates? [Non-Functional, Observability, Gap, Spec §FR-006, Spec §SC-012]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 - Are assumptions about upstream authentication and assignment systems translated into explicit requirement constraints or fallback expectations? [Dependencies, Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are dependency requirements defined for submission-repository availability, including failure-mode classifications used by this feature? [Dependencies, Gap, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are contract boundaries for external role/entitlement sources specified so requirement interpretation stays stable across integrations? [Dependencies, Gap, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-008]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK026 - Is the requirement term "immediate" defined with measurable timing semantics across revocation enforcement and retry behavior? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK027 - Do requirements resolve potential conflict between "allow immediate retry" and "throttle repeated requests" with explicit retry-sequence rules? [Conflict, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK028 - Is a stable requirement/acceptance traceability convention defined for references beyond FR/SC labels (for example edge cases and assumptions)? [Traceability, Gap, Spec §Traceability Matrix]
